# Hello this is my project from devChallenges.io

## Rules:

1. I can add my own funcions until I care about user stories: user stories:

- User story: I can see at least 2 types of question: a city is the capital of.. or a flag belong to country.
- User story: I can see select an answer
- User story: I can see if my answer is correct or incorrect
- User story: When I answer correctly, I can move on to the next question
- User story: When I answer incorrectly, I can see my results and try again
- User story: I can try again

2. I don't have to care that much about design but I like the original one so I will try to do it in the same way.

3. I will be using api https://restcountries.eu/
